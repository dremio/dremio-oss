The Checker Framework Copyright 2004-present by the Checker Framework developers   Most of the Checker Framework is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPL2), with the classpath exception.  The text of this license appears below.  This is the same license used for OpenJDK.  A few parts of the Checker Framework have more permissive licenses.   * The annotations are licensed under the MIT License.  (The text of this    license appears below.)  More specifically, all the parts of the Checker    Framework that you might want to include with your own program use the    MIT License.  This is the checker-qual.jar file and all the files that    appear in it:  every file in a qual/ directory, plus utility files such    as NullnessUtil.java, RegexUtil.java, SignednessUtil.java, etc.    In addition, the cleanroom implementations of third-party annotations,    which the Checker Framework recognizes as aliases for its own    annotations, are licensed under the MIT License.  Some external libraries that are included with the Checker Framework have different licenses.   * javaparser is dual licensed under the LGPL or the Apache license -- you    may use it under whichever one you want.  (The javaparser source code    contains a file with the text of the GPL, but it is not clear why, since    javaparser does not use the GPL.)  See file stubparser/LICENSE    and the source code of all its files.   * JUnit is licensed under the Common Public License v1.0 (see    http://www.junit.org/license), with parts (Hamcrest) licensed under the    BSD License (see http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/).   * Libraries in plume-lib (https://github.com/plume-lib/) are licensed    under the MIT License.  The Checker Framework includes annotations for the JDK in directory checker/jdk/, and for some other libraries.  Each annotated library uses the same license as the unannotated version of the library.
