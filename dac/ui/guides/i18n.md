# Internationalization

We use [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl).

However, we do not use `defaultMessage`, even English is looked up via `id`.
Translation strings are stored in `src/locales`.

Keys should follow the form `${grouping}.${specifier}`.
A good grouping would be the name of the object type the string relates to, e.g. "Dataset".

Always using a translation dictionary helps encourage the reuse of strings which benefits consistency within the app. 

If you need to add a supported locale, import both its react-intl/locale-data and its src/locales in src/containers/Root.js.
You will also need to correctly choose the src/locales data to pass to IntlProvider (see "Future" below).

You can override the language with `localStoreage.language` (following BCP 47). 
You can also specify two debugging languages this way:
- `ids`: will show the IDs in the UI.
- `double`: will double the default locale's strings.

Unit Tests:
In `test/testHelp.js` we swizzle `Module.prototype.require` to resolve to a stub `react-intl` (see notes there as to why).
As you use more of `react-intl` you will need to add additional stubs.

Future:
- Correctly choose the src/locales data to pass to IntlProvider.
- RTL
- Merging of extended language locales like 'en-US' with base 'en'.
