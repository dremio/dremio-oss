   * for the inner data vector in each copyInnerList call of inner list vector. The leaf level copyInnerList call will

   * which would enable us to make use of existing copy methods instead of introducing this new method. However the issue
   * with that is the inner vector record count can be large and so might not fit in the 2-byte limit of sv. Also
   * it would need allocating a large buffer for each level and setting the sv index for each inner vector member)
