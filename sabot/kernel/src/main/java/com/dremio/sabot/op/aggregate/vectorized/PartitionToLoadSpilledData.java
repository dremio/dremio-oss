/**
 *
 * This partition is also known as "EXTRA PARTITION" or "READ PARTITION".
 * The data structures in this partition are pre-allocated (upfront) during
 * operator setup with the purpose of always having enough memory to load a
 * single spilled batch of data from a partition.
 *
 * {@link VectorizedHashAggOperator} is responsible for allocating the
 * memory for this partition and it should happen at the very beginning
 * during operator setup when we take care of other kinds of pre-allocation.
 * The memory associated with data structures here will not be released
 * until operator itself is closed; all data has been pumped out of the
 * operator.
 *
 * This partition is _NOT_ accounted towards the number of partitions used
 * by {@link VectorizedHashAggOperator} to partition/distribute the
 * incoming data. It is sort of a holder with pre-allocated data
 * structures to deserialize spilled batch which then serves as a new
 * incoming into the operator.
 *
 * Description of data structures:
 *
 * (1) Fixed Width Buffer:
 *
 * ArrowBuf to hold pivoted data for fixed width GROUP BY key columns. We spill
 * pivoted data and we read back the same pivoted streams which are good enough
 * to be re-inserted into the hash tables when we start processing a particular
 * spilled partition and re-partition. So, we don't have to pivot again after
 * reading a spilled batch.
 *
 * (2) Variable Width Buffer:
 *
 * ArrowBuf to hold pivoted data for variable width GROUP BY key columns.
 * Similar to fixed width pivoted data, this is used as is for re-partitioning
 * and insertion into multiple hash tables.
 *
 * (3) Post Spill Accumulator Vectors:
 *
 * Along with pivoted key data from hash table, we also spill accumulator output
 * vectors which hold computed values. When we read back a spilled batch,
 * it has the accumulator vectors too and they should now become as input
 * accumulator vectors.
 *
 * Together these data structures constitute "post-spill" incoming batch
 * which is used by the operator to restart aggregation processing --
 * re-partitioning, accumulation etc.
