      \ In order to use window frames effectively, it's essential to have the data within the window arranged in a specific way.\

description: "Returns an approximate distinct value number, similar to `COUNT(DISTINCT col)`. NDV can return results faster than using the combination of COUNT and DISTINCT while using a constant amount of memory, resulting in less memory usage for columns with high cardinality."
